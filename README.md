# GuessTheNumber
The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. This project helps in understanding basic JavaScript concepts, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and working with random numbers.

# Features

Random Number Generation: A random number is generated within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100) at the start of each game session.

User Input: Players can input their guesses through a text field.

Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.

Guess Count: The game keeps track of the number of guesses the player has made.

Game End: When the correct number is guessed, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the player can choose to reset the game.

# Technologies Used

HTML: To structure the game interface.

CSS: To style the game elements.

JavaScript: To handle the game logic and interactivity.
